# Using Replicate in Node.js with p5.js for Machine Learning Models

This repo contains a "hello world" example demonstrating the how to prompt a machine learning model hosted by Replicate via node.js and send the results to a p5.js sketch. This example is for the [Programming from A to Z](https://github.com/Programming-from-A-to-Z/A2Z-F24) class at ITP, NYU. (Students in the class, contact me for your API key!)

## Replicate

[Replicate](https://replicate.com/) is a platform for running machine learning models in the cloud from your own code. [Browse models](https://replicate.com/explore).

For detailed usage, setup, and more, here is the official [Replicate Documentation for Node.js](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/nodejs).
